A Colloquial Definition of Big, Open, and Personal Data
-----------

*Open Data gets conflated with personal data; everyone talks about big data; yet no-one is sure what it is; we're all concerned about personal data; …* 

Here are a three **distinct** concepts of data:

1. Big Data
2. Open Data
3. Personal Data

The emphasis lies on 'distinct'. Open data can be big, but doesn't have to be. Big data is often based on personal data, but not necessarily.  
 
The definitions are *colloquial*. They trade off accuracy with ease of understanding. For people who feel uneasy about that, I have attached a more formal definition. 

I do not claim that these definitions are exhaustive. 

The formal definitions are **not** legal advise. Always understand the context. 


### Big Data is (i) data that cannot be handled with conventional tools *and/or* (ii) the idea that large, granular amounts of data create value almost automatically.  


**More formal**

There is no formal definition of Big Data – though many have tried.


### Open Data is data that anyone can use; without legal, technical or financial barriers.

**More formal**

The [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://opendefinition.org/) writes: 

>A piece of data or content is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it — subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike.


### Personal Data is data derived from individuals and where you can distinguish an individual from other people in the group.

**More formal**

A technical definition of *personally identifiable information* (PII) from the [ISO 29100](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=45123) standard (privacy framework).
> any information that (a) can be used to identify the PII principal to whom such information relates, or (b) is or might be directly or indirectly linked to a PII principal. 

NB: To determine the risk of re-identification you have to consider all means which can reasonably be used by anyone (including the data holder) to identify the person. 
 

### Big and Open
We can think of it in two ways:

1. Big Data that is available as Open Data (see our Big Data Publishing guide) or
2. Open Data that combined with other information achieves Big Data status.

Governments around the world are excited about this because they see its potential for transparency and economic growth. However, at the moment most of it is just data, not information, and even more of it is not open.


### Big and Personal 

This is the intersection where big business gets excited. Enhanced selling, geo-targeted advertising, personalised recommendations all derive from algorithms mining customer (= people) data. The few examples where individuals benefit from Big Data do not balance this asymmetry. The public are passive when it comes to Big Data. With more algorithm shaping our lives than ever before (take credit scoring for example), combining Big and Personal Data will continue to create tensions.

### Big Open Personal (BOP) Data 

Does it exist? It would require a special type of *data nudist* to be willing to share large amounts of his/her personal life. Some have hopes in people voluntarily contributing to large open scientific dataset that have the potential to advance medicine for example. Combining your available online activities such as social media data may be getting close to a combination of all three. It is essentially a flavour with more than an acquired taste; for many not acceptable.
