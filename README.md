A Colloquial Definition of Big, Open, and Personal Data
-----------


I do not claim that the definitions are exhaustive.

**More formal**

The [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://opendefinition.org/) writes: 

>A piece of data or content is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it â€” subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike.


### Personal Data is data derived from individuals, where you can distinguish an individual from other people in the group.

**More formal**

A technical definition of *personally identifiable information* (PII) from the [ISO 29100](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=45123) standard (privacy framework).
> any information that (a) can be used to identify the PII principal to whom such information relates, or (b) is or might be directly or indirectly linked to a PII principal. 

NB: To determine the risk of re-identification you have to consider all means which can reasonably be used by anyone (including the data holder) to identify the person.
